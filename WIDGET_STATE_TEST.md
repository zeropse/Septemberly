## Implementation Details

### Changes Made:

1. **Content.jsx**:

   - Removed `AnimatePresence` and widget unmounting
   - All widgets now stay mounted and are hidden/shown with CSS
   - This preserves all component state including timers

2. **Pomodoro.jsx**:

   - Enhanced localStorage to save running state and timestamp
   - Added time calculation for elapsed time when switching back
   - Timer automatically continues where it left off
   - Handles session transitions that may occur while away

3. **All Other Widgets**:
   - Already had proper localStorage usage
   - Now benefit from staying mounted (no re-initialization)

## Benefits:

- ✅ Timers continue running in background
- ✅ All form data persists
- ✅ Better user experience
- ✅ No data loss when switching
- ✅ Consistent state management across all widgets
